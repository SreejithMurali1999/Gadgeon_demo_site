        <p>Talent sourcing via partner model is a well-established practice in the industry. Enterprises need a technology partner who is reliable and experienced like Gadgeon to meet the talent<br> challenges quickly and effectively. We offer multiple project engagement models with flexibility and high success rates like staff augmentation â€“ hiring a developer model; fixed cost,<br> time & cost model; and managed agile team.
        <br><br>
        Extended Engineering team is a joint journey where Gadgeon guides our customers by following a phased industry-standard framework for transition, service delivery, and continuous<br> optimization. This model involves teams that are a true extension to the client's team and are mainly placed at Gadgeon's offshore development location(s). It allows maximum flexibility<br> in the execution of multiple projects using the best-fit pricing model.
        <br><br>
        When it comes to staffing solutions, one model doesn't fit all the requirements. Gadgeon's managed capacity services aim at helping customers in their digital journey by offering flexible <br>staffing solutions where customers buy services. At the same time, Gadgeon defines and provides capacity, and the customer provides overall direction. In contrast, Gadgeon manages and <br>control the output of the service. The processes are tailored according to the customer processes. The output is measured through agreed delivery and performance metrics and supports <br>multiple pricing models.</p>
